# Intro to Logic and Computational Thinking

## Turing Machine

* Model invented by Alan Turing
  * father of digital thining
* computational problems can be broken down into 0 and 1
  * "on" and "off"
  * "true" and "false"
* all modern computers are essentially very complex Turing machines turning lots of switches off and on
* foundations of computer systems and the logic that makes them up are made up of sets of switches all working together

| Switch 1 | Switch 2 |
|:-------: | :------: |
| 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |

* if each combination "turns on " a different color we can now have three color lights using just two switches

| Switch 1 | Switch 2 | Color |
|:-------: | :------: | :---: |
| 0 | 0 | Off |
| 0 | 1 | Red |
| 1 | 0 | Green |
| 1 | 1 | Blue |

* by using this simple language you can create very complex combinations to represent just about anything

## Bits and Bytes

* In computer science the Turing model is called a "binary" model
* 0 and 1 are a pair of digits or a "binary digit" aka bit
* a bit in computer science are the two states 0 and 1 and the basic unit of the binary systems computers use
* in the previous example of two light switches that would be a two bit system
  * two binary states working together to form four different combinations producing a lights off state and three different colored lights on states
* modern computers use eight bits in combination to form the fundamental unit of digital information - byte
* byte reprensentation of the letter "A" in binary

| Bit 1 | Bit 2 | Bit 3 | Bit 4 | Bit 5 | Bit 6 | Bit 7 | Bit 8 | Letter |
|:---: | :---: | :---: |:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | A |

* how data travels
  * user presses letter A on computer
  * keyboard sends a signal to processor that translates signal to byte representation above
  * when the CPU gets the digital combination it knows it needs to send a signal to the screen to draw the letter "A"
  * all computers are their core use a simlar model

## Algorithms

* binary model is the fundmentl language the microprocessors in your computer understands
* computers are extremely good at performing repeatable tasks in a predictable way
* these instructions always do the same thing and, when the program is written well, it does them consistently and without errors

### Algorithms in Real Life

These instructions are called algorithms. Author Yuval Noah Harari defines an algorithm this way "An algorithm is a methodical set of steps that can be used to make calculations, resolve problems and reach decisions. An algorithm isnâ€™t a particular calculation, but the method followed when making the calculation."

* some refer to an algorithm as a recipe
* an algorithm is a repeatable set of steps that can take inputs and that produce a predictable, consistent output.
* simple making a sandwich algorithm
  * Step 1: set out the ingredients: peanut butter, jelly, bread, and a spreader
  * Step 2: open the jars of peanut butter and jelly
  * Step 3: Set out two pieces of bread on a flat surface
  * Step 4: Spread a thin amount of peanut butter on one slice of bread
  * Step 5: Spread a thin amount of jelly on the other slice of bread
  * Step 6: Place one slice of bread on top of the other
  * Step 7: Enjoy!
* very rudamentary description but point is we are describing a process for making a sandwich which is repeatable and results in the same output...a sandwich

### Algorithms and Computer Science

* when programmers write computer programs they are essentially writing recipes just like this to tell the computer what to do

## Logic and Computer Science

Logic is a science that analyzes concepts and ideas and attempts to provide rules for ordered thinking and find fallacies for improper thinking. Computers use programs to process data and produce some kind of output like images, music, spreadsheets, and online courses.

### What is Logic

* science that was discovered by Aristotle in early 400 BC
* Aristole one of the three major Greek thinkers of the period
  * Aristotle
  * Plato
  * Socrates
  * Socrates > Plato > Aristotle
* logic is a system of right reason
* logic tries to teach us there's is a right way that ideas should relate to one another particularly when you're trying to make an arguement
* logic helps us analye arguements
* the rules of logic make up arguements taht are used to convey the truth value of ideas
* "Logic is the science that evaluates arguments" - Hurley
* when we study logic we are studying rules
* the study of rules are called syllogisms
* syllogisms are the rules that we use to construct the arguments that help us determine which ideas are true and false
* whole study of study in logic that studies incorrect reasoning or fallacies
* logic is a science, its research and discovery
* like mathematics logic wasn't invented but discovered
* Aristotle was the first person to systematize the rules that made up formal logic
